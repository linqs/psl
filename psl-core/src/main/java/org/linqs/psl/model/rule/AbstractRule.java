/**
 * Base class for all (first order, i.e., not ground) rules.
 *
 * Care should always be taken when creating multiple instance of the same rule (e.g. through deserialization) or checking rules for equality.
 * In general, there should only be one instance of each rule, but this is not tightly enforced.
 * Rule hashes are by default their identity hash code (object id).
 * This means that it may be possible to have rules that are equal(), but that do not have matching hashes.
