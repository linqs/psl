/**
 * A data model for retrieving and persisting {@link GroundAtom GroundAtoms}.
 * <p>
 * Every GroundAtom retrieved from a Database is either a {@link RandomVariableAtom}
 * or an {@link ObservedAtom}. The method {@link #getAtom(Predicate, Constant...)}
 * determines which type a GroundAtom is. In addition, a GroundAtom with a
 * {@link StandardPredicate} can be persisted in a Database. If a
 * GroundAtom is persisted, it is persisted in one of the Partitions the
 * Database can read and is available for querying via {@link #executeQuery(DatabaseQuery)}.
 * 
 * <h2>Setup</h2>
 * 
 * Databases are instantiated via {@link DataStore#getDatabase} methods.
 * <p>
 * A Database writes to and reads from one {@link Partition} of a DataStore
 * and can read from additional Partitions. The write Partition of a Database
 * may not be a read (or write) Partition of any other Database.
 * <p>
 * A Database can be instantiated with a set of StandardPredicates
 * to close. (Any StandardPredicate not closed initially remains open). Whether
 * a StandardPredicate is open or closed affects the behavior of
 * {@link #getAtom(Predicate, Constant...)}.
 * 
 * <h2>Retrieving GroundAtoms</h2>
 * 
 * A Database is the canonical source for a set of GroundAtoms.
 * GroundAtoms should only be retrieved via {@link #getAtom(Predicate, Constant...)}
 * to ensure there exists only a single object for each GroundAtom from the Database.
 * (However, a Database might be wrapped in an {@link AtomManager}, which will pass
 * through calls to {@link AtomManager#getAtom(Predicate, Constant...)}.)
 * <p>
 * A Database contains an {@link AtomCache} which is used to store GroundAtoms
 * that have been instantiated in memory and ensure these objects are unique.
 * The AtomCache is accessible via {@link #getAtomCache()}.
 * 
 * <h2>Persisting RandomVariableAtoms</h2>
 * 
 * A RandomVariableAtom can be persisted (including updated) in the write
 * Partition via {@link #commit(RandomVariableAtom)} or
 * {@link RandomVariableAtom#commitToDB()}.
 * 
 * <h2>Querying for Groundings</h2>
 * 
 * {@link DatabaseQuery DatabaseQueries} can be run via {@link #executeQuery(DatabaseQuery)}.
 * Note that queries only act on the GroundAtoms persisted in Partitions and
 * GroundAtoms with {@link FunctionalPredicate FunctionalPredicates}.
